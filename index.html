    <p><br><br>Algor LOMBAKO KONGA is a Congolese citizen in his early twenties that migrated to Canada for study purpose. Based in Toronto,  Ontario, he is currently studying Computer Programming and Analysis at George Brown College. <br>
       He grew up in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo where he first pursued the primary curriculum to acquire basic knowledge, and continued in literary sciences as a specialization. <br> 
       During his second curriculum, he acquired knowledge on the Latin culture, African and Eastern literature, with an accent on textual analysis. <br> 
       Always important to specify that even though the emphasis was on letters, he graduated with more than ninety percent in courses like geometry, arithmetic, trigonometry, and physics. <br>
       It is difficult to explain the choice of computer science because it stems from the attraction and passion he has always had for the field. <br> 
       Initially focused on gaming essentially, this interest has diversified by touching web development, back and front-end, application development, data management and much moreâ€¦ <br>
        His hobbies are football, basketball, photography, budding geniuses and, of course, coding.

          <p>He has been introduced to the concepts of Abstract Data Structures such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks and Binary Trees. 
            Data structures are implemented in the software development process, through accompanying algorithms, in order to develop efficient, robust and creative software. 
            A brief, yet effective introduction to Algorithm Analysis has been provided to further stimulate the theoretical rhetoric of the concepts of computation and to elevate Programming into Computer Science. 
            The discussion of each ADT (Abstract Data Types) included its conceptual definition, advantages and disadvantages in the areas of creating, appending, referencing, searching, sorting, memory efficiency, 
            access-time efficiency, the applications of the ADT, actual implementation of some of the ADT's and their respective functions, and finally an introduction to their pre-defined implementations in Java.</p>
